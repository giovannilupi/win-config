# win-config

This repository contains a collection of configuration files created for my Windows 10 setup.

For development I am prevalently using Virtual Machines (VMs) running Linux by leveraging the SSH remote extension in Visual Studio Code. To maintain consistency in path handling between Windows and Linux systems, I predominantly use Git Bash, which shares the same path separator as Linux. This choice ensures consistency in path handling and command syntax between Windows and Linux systems, minimizing friction during development tasks.

To maintain visual coherence and enhance readability, I opt for a dark theme across various applications. In particular, I utilize the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) dark theme, which provides a pleasing aesthetic while ensuring comfortable usage across different contexts.
